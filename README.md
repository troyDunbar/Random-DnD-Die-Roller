# DnD-Die-Roller
Dice rolling application used to simulate Dungeons and Dragons effects such as rolling multiple die, giving advantages and disadvantages, and choosing the sided die to roll. 

This project was created for my Software Engineering course at Oakland community College.

Writting in Java alongside the use of JavaFX through SceneBuilder this project was to display the combination of front-end and back-end development to create a useful and functional application. 

This program was written by myself in roughly a week with an hour or so of work put into it each day. The loops and logical gates used through switch cases and if-statmetns allow for different sided bie to be used, and for the die to be rolled up to 100 times, as anything greater then 100 would never be used in a real DnD game and would take to long to run.
